# Human Image Segmentation with DeepLabV3+

This repository dedicated to segmenting humans in images using the powerful DeepLabV3+ architecture. DeepLabV3+ incorporates a special attention mechanism called Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE), enhancing its ability to understand and segment human subjects accurately.

In this project, we provide everything you need to start segmenting human images effortlessly. Our model, based on DeepLabV3+, leverages the integrated SE blocks to achieve state-of-the-art performance in human image segmentation tasks.

We offer easy-to-use tools for processing the Person Segmentation dataset, ensuring your data is ready for training without hassle. With TensorFlow 2.10.0 and Python 3.10, training your segmentation model is straightforward. We've streamlined the process so you can focus on getting results. Assessing your model's performance is also simple with our evaluation tools, including metrics like pixel accuracy and Intersection over Union (IoU).

We welcome contributions and feedback from the community. Feel free to get involved and help us improve!
